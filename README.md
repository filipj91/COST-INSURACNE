# COST-INSURECNE

An interactive dashboard built with Streamlit for analyzing and predicting health insurance costs in the US. The project integrates Python, Plotly, Pandas, and a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and pytest, ensuring high code quality and seamless deployment.

## Dashboard Features

### Predictive Model Visualization
- Comparison of actual insurance costs with model predictions using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
- Interactive Plotly graphs, including dynamic animations for better trend analysis.

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated code testing with pytest.
- GitHub Actions pipeline for smooth testing and deployment.

### Aesthetic and Functional Design
- Responsive user interface with custom CSS.
- Modern design tailored for data visualization needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages** Python
- **Libraries**
  - Streamlit: For building the interactive dashboard.
  - Plotly: For creating dynamic and interactive charts.
  - Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation.

- **CI/CD**
  - GitHub Actions: For automated testing and deployment.
  - pytest: For testing predictive models.

## Key Insights
The dashboard features a "Comparison of Predictions with Actual Values" chart that:
- Highlights differences between actual insurance costs and model predictions.
- Enables visual error analysis to assess model accuracy.
- Includes an animation for step-by-step data presentation.

## Summary
This project demonstrates practical application of data analytics, machine learning, and engineering tools for insurance cost prediction. The integration of CI/CD showcases a focus on code quality and process automation, making it a robust and scalable solution.
