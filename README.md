# COST-INSURECNE
The project is an interactive dashboard in Streamlit for analyzing and predicting health insurance costs in the US. Uses Python, Plotly, Pandas, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions and pytest. It offers visualizations, an aesthetic interface, and automatic code testing and deployment.

Project Description
This project presents a complete dashboard created in Streamlit, used to analyze and predict health insurance costs in the United States. The project integrates elements of Data Science, Machine Learning, and CI/CD, and its goal is to show analytical, programming, and implementation skills.

Dashboard Features

Visualization of predictive model results:

Comparison of actual insurance costs with model predictions:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Interactive graph in Plotly technology.
- Animation enabling dynamic presentation of data.

CI/CD process description:

Automatic code testing using pytest.
GitHub Actions configuration for smooth deployment and testing.
Displaying a sample YAML file illustrating the pipeline.

Aesthetic and functional presentation:

Responsive UI with custom CSS.
Modern design adapted to the needs of data visualization.
Technologies Used in the Project

Programming Languages:
- Python
- Libraries:
- Streamlit - for building an interactive dashboard.
- Plotly - for creating dynamic charts.
- Pandas and NumPy - for data manipulation.

CI/CD:
GitHub Actions - for automated code testing and deployment.
pytest - for testing models.

The dashboard includes a "Comparison of Predictions with Actual Values" chart that:

- Shows the differences between actual insurance costs and model predictions.

- Allows you to assess the accuracy of the models through visual error analysis.

- Includes an animation that presents the data step by step for a better understanding of trends.

CI/CD

The project has been integrated with CI/CD, which allows:
- Automatic code testing using pytest.
- Automatic deployment after passing tests.
- Supporting good data engineering practices in a production context.

Summary
This project demonstrates the use of analytical and engineering tools in a practical case of insurance cost prediction. The inclusion of CI/CD emphasizes the focus on code quality and process automation.
